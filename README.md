# SCEPTR Publication Analyses

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/768023440.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14285923)

This is a repository containing code that was used to conduct the model analyses and generate the plots seen in our manuscript ["Contrastive learning of T cell receptor representations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06397).
